# Overview
This repository consists of 1 bigger project and 2 smaller assignments I did for a class.

In this notebook I analyzed data regarding changes in environmental factors in Poland over the course of 59 years - from 1960 to 2019.

## Polish teenagers in prison
In this one I conducted a short and basic analysis of data taken from governmental statistics, which included amount of teenagers in prison divided into groups by age and gender.

## Edgar Allan Poe's short stories analysis
If you've recently read a story by this writer and want to find a similar one, take a look at this notebook. Here I took data consisting of writer's 70 short stories and analyzed their vocabulary e.g. which words appeared most frequently. I also compared stories' similarity and differences.
